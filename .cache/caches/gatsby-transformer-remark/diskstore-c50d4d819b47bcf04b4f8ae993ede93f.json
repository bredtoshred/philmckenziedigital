My coworkers consisted of a student developer, a full time Front End Developer, a full time Back End Developer and a Project Manager and at the start and end of my time there we had a UX Designer as well.</p>\n<h2>Why</h2>\n<p>Initially the vast majority of my work revolved around styling pages for mobile devices, addressing a11y issues, and developing designs from the UX designer. After the site was rolled out my focus shifted to a full on site repair role. Fortunately we did not have many issues after rolling out the site, however the styling related ones were all dealt to me.</p>\n<p>After the site had been live for a couple months and the bugs we had at launch had all been squashed I switched to a role that was held UX and half Development. At this point our full time UX Developer had left and I stepped up to work out new page designs for our other projects. The majority of this work focused on the refinement of a student facing portal for residence hall related services.</p>\n<p>When I was not designing new pages I was being tasked with refining styles of our current pages. One instance of this which was a print version of an online parking permit that was required by all 8,036 freshman coming to live on campus. The biggest challenge with a design like this was ensuring that it would print with good contrast ratios and in the proper format on all devices. I rigorously tested this design across all operating systems, browsers and eras of technology to ensure literally everyone and their grandma could print a permit.</p>"}
